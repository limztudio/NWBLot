# Buffer byte ranges

GPU tasks synchronize the byte intervals declared in `GpuTaskResourceUse::range.bufferRange`:

```cpp
const GpuTaskResourceUse use{
    .resource = bufferResource,
    .range = GpuTaskResourceRange{ .bufferRange = BufferRange(256u, 128u) },
    .requiredState = ResourceStates::UnorderedAccess,
    .access = GpuTaskResourceAccess::Write,
};
```

This declaration covers bytes `[256, 384)`. Disjoint intervals do not create resource hazards; overlapping reads/writes retain the required ordering. State transitions, packet state seeds, terminal exports, and queue-family ownership transfers preserve the affected intervals, including when a consumer spans several producers.

Omitting the range keeps the whole-buffer default. `BufferRange(offset, BufferRange::AllBytes)` covers the remaining bytes from that offset. Empty, overflowing, and out-of-bounds task ranges are rejected. Acceleration structures retain whole-allocation synchronization.

The declaration must cover every byte touched by the task's commands and internal state transitions. For explicit native transitions, pass the same range as the last argument to `CommandList::setBufferState(buffer, state, forceMemoryDependency, range)`. Whole-buffer operations, including implicit vertex/index/indirect binding state transitions, still require whole-buffer declarations. Built-in uploads and copies declare and transition their exact transfer intervals; buffer clears cover the whole buffer.

A pending queue-family release must be acquired with its original byte interval. Handoff subset selection rejects clipping a pending release. Release separate intervals on the producer when consumers need independent ownership ranges.
